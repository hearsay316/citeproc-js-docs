``citeproc-js`` originated as a volunteer contribution to Zotero
development `in January of 2009`__, and the processor debuted at the `end
of May in the following year`__. My repository habits are undisciplined.
Multiple checkins covering a given issue are common, and tagged
releases for small fixes are the norm, hence the length of the
version listing.
