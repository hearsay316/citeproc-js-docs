Fix subsequent-author-substitute

The move to keyed macro storage (in 1.1.0, February 2015)
broke subsequent-author-substitute for macros shared between
cs:citation and cs:bibliography. Macros in cs:citation are
build first at processor instantiation, so functions needed
for this attribute were not installed on the rendering nodes,
and the attribute lost its effect.

This fix repairs subsequent-author-substitute only. A similar
issue persists (I believe) for second-field-align. That would
be much harder to address, but as the first-occurring "field"
in that case can be more easily expressed without resorting to
a macro, the bug has less impact there.
